## üìù Introduction

This repository highlights my work on Kaggle, where I have applied various data science techniques to solve real-world problems. The projects cover domains such as:
- E-commerce
- Finance
- Healthcare
- Image Processing

I aim to showcase my technical expertise and the insights I derived from these datasets.

## üöÄ Projects

### Project 1: **[Forecasting Sticker Sales with XGboost optimized with Optuna for better accuracy](https://github.com/Arshad020/Arshad-Rafid-Data-science-Portfolio/tree/main/Forecasting%20Sticker%20Sales)**

**Objective:**  The objective of this challenge is to forecast sticker sales in different countries.

**Description:**
The goal of the Tabular Playground Series is to provide the Kaggle community with a variety of fairly light-weight challenges that can be used to learn and sharpen skills in different aspects of machine learning and data science. The duration of each competition will generally only last a few weeks, and may have longer or shorter durations depending on the challenge. The challenges will generally use fairly light-weight datasets that are synthetically generated from real-world data, and will provide an opportunity to quickly iterate through various model and feature engineering ideas, create visualizations, etc.

### Project 2: **[Using Neural Network Classifier to solve "Titanic-Machine Learning from Disaster](https://github.com/Arshad020/Arshad-Rafid-Data-science-Portfolio/tree/main/NN_classifier_titanic)**

**Objective:**  Using machine learning to create a model that predicts which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck.

**Description:**
The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.

On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the widely considered ‚Äúunsinkable‚Äù RMS Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg. Unfortunately, there weren‚Äôt enough lifeboats for everyone onboard, resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.

While there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some groups of people were more likely to survive than others.

In this challenge, we ask you to build a predictive model that answers the question: ‚Äúwhat sorts of people were more likely to survive?‚Äù using passenger data (ie name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc).

### Project 3: **[Experimenting with K nearest neighbor and Principal Component Analysis to solve "Interested in Bio-Signals ‚Åâ" challenge](https://github.com/Arshad020/Arshad-Rafid-Data-science-Portfolio/tree/main/Smoker%20status%20prediction%20using%20bio-signal%20data)**

**Objective:**  The task is to use binary classification to predict a patient's smoking status given information about various other health indicators. Good luck!

**Description:**
The dataset for this competition (both train and test) was generated from a deep learning model trained on the Smoker Status Prediction using Bio-Signals dataset.
