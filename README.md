## üìù Introduction

This repository highlights my work on Kaggle, where I have applied various data science techniques to solve real-world problems. The projects cover domains such as:
- E-commerce
- Finance
- Healthcare
- Image Processing

I aim to showcase my technical expertise and the insights I derived from these datasets.

## üöÄ Projects

### Project 1: **[Forecasting Sticker Sales(Time series data) with XGboost, and optimized with Optuna for better accuracy](https://github.com/Arshad020/Arshad-Rafid-Data-science-Portfolio/tree/main/Forecasting%20Sticker%20Sales)**

**Objective:**  The objective of this challenge is to forecast sticker sales in different countries.

**Description:**
The goal of the Tabular Playground Series is to provide the Kaggle community with a variety of fairly light-weight challenges that can be used to learn and sharpen skills in different aspects of machine learning and data science. The duration of each competition will generally only last a few weeks, and may have longer or shorter durations depending on the challenge. The challenges will generally use fairly light-weight datasets that are synthetically generated from real-world data, and will provide an opportunity to quickly iterate through various model and feature engineering ideas, create visualizations, etc.

### Project 2: **[Using Neural Network Classifier to solve "Titanic-Machine Learning from Disaster](https://github.com/Arshad020/Arshad-Rafid-Data-science-Portfolio/tree/main/NN_classifier_titanic)**

**Objective:**  Using machine learning to create a model that predicts which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck.

**Description:**
The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.

On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the widely considered ‚Äúunsinkable‚Äù RMS Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg. Unfortunately, there weren‚Äôt enough lifeboats for everyone onboard, resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.

While there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some groups of people were more likely to survive than others.

In this challenge, we ask you to build a predictive model that answers the question: ‚Äúwhat sorts of people were more likely to survive?‚Äù using passenger data (ie name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc).

### Project 3: **[Experimenting with K nearest neighbor and Principal Component Analysis to solve "Interested in Bio-Signals ‚Åâ" challenge](https://github.com/Arshad020/Arshad-Rafid-Data-science-Portfolio/tree/main/Smoker%20status%20prediction%20using%20bio-signal%20data)**

**Objective:**  The task is to use binary classification to predict a patient's smoking status given information about various other health indicators. Good luck!

**Description:**
The dataset for this competition (both train and test) was generated from a deep learning model trained on the Smoker Status Prediction using Bio-Signals dataset.

### Project 4: **[Solving "House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques" competition with XGboost](https://github.com/Arshad020/Arshad-Rafid-Data-science-Portfolio/tree/main/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques)**

**Objective:**  The task is predict the sales price for each house. For each Id in the test set, you must predict the value of the SalePrice variable.

**Description:**
Ask a home buyer to describe their dream house, and they probably won't begin with the height of the basement ceiling or the proximity to an east-west railroad. But this playground competition's dataset proves that much more influences price negotiations than the number of bedrooms or a white-picket fence.

With 79 explanatory variables describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa, this competition challenges you to predict the final price of each home.


### Project 5: **[CIDAUT AI Fake Scene Classification 2024 solved with Xception model](https://github.com/Arshad020/Arshad-Rafid-Data-science-Portfolio/tree/main/AI%20Fake%20Scene%20Classification)**

**Objective:**  Classify if an autonomous driving scene is real or fake

Given an image, provide the probability of it being real (1) or fake (0).

**Description:**
You need to train neural networks or use any algorithm to classify if an image of a driving scenario is real or fake.

images are in RGB format compressed in JPEG format.
labels indicate (1) real and (0) fake
binary classification
you can do your own train/validation split
for the test images, you do not have access to the labels. See sample_submission.csv in the Data section
code should be in Python
you can use Tensorflow, Keras, PyTorch, etc.
you can use public GitHub repositories and models
you can use other publicly available datasets
